## 📘 API Documentation

Kennerliga provides fully browsable and testable API documentation using **Swagger UI**.

- Swagger UI: [http://localhost:8000/api/docs/](http://localhost:8000/api/docs/)
- OpenAPI schema: [http://localhost:8000/api/schema/](http://localhost:8000/api/schema/)
- Redoc (optional): [http://localhost:8000/api/redoc/](http://localhost:8000/api/redoc/)

## 🧩 Frontend Setup (Quasar – WIP)

The frontend is built using the [Quasar Framework](https://quasar.dev) (Vue.js) and will be served separately. To set it up:

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
quasar dev
```

_This part is still under development. Stay tuned!_

## 🔔 Push Notifications

Installed users are prompted to enable notifications for registration openings,
season starts, and when it is their turn. Configure the following environment
variables on the Django host before deploying:

```env
VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=<base64url VAPID public key>
VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY=<VAPID private key PEM>
VAPID_SUBJECT=mailto:admin@example.com
```

Generate a VAPID key pair with the `vapid --gen` utility installed by
`pywebpush`. Keep the private key secret. Then run the Django migrations before
deploying the frontend so subscriptions can be stored.

## 🔐 Authentication

Kennerliga uses token-based authentication with optional login/logout endpoints:

- `/api/login/` – custom login  
- `/api/logout/` – logout  
- `/api/api-token-auth/` – DRF token endpoint  

Tokens are required for most write actions (CRUD, posting results, etc.).
